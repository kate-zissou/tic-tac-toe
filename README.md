## Simple Tic-Tac-Toe (Python) Project
This is a project for Jetbrains Academy where I am building a simple tic-tac-toe game using Python and Pygame library.

# Features
Graphical user interface (GUI) to display the game board
Two players can take turns making moves
Detects when a player has won or when the game is a draw
Reset button to start a new game

# How to Run
Clone the project repository
Install Pygame library by running pip install pygame
Run main.py to start the game

# Status
Currently working on implementing win and draw detection, as well as reset button functionality.

# Future Improvements
Add a single player mode where the player plays against the computer
Improve the computer AI to make it more challenging to beat
Add a high score board to keep track of player scores
